# Troubleshooting

- **The updated metadata is not showing in one/a few customs, but some others do:**
  - Probably the charter updated the song itself and changed the shortname of the custom you've downloaded. Contact me if this happens.

- **The metadata of the song is updated but I notice the lipsync/venues is gone:**
  - ~~Probably I forgot to properly place the updated song's MILO file inside the patch. All songs that has fixed album arts must have a copy of the MILO file inside the patch (since the patch tries to read both files from the patch and not from the custom file anymore). Contact me if this happens.~~
    - ***Update:*** *As I mentioned eariler, this behavior has changed as from Rock Band 3 Deluxe `version 1.1.0-beta11`, where album artworks can be read directly from the patch without needing to use the `alternate_path` value on the DTA, and with this, there's no need to have a copy of the song's MILO file on the patch, making this error unlikely to happen on the `version 1.1.0-beta11` or newer.*

- **After installing _C3 Library Patch_, some official songs/DLCs are using artworks from another song:**
  - This happens because a custom is using the same internal shortname of a official song/DLC. Contact me if this happens, as the updated song must be removed from the patch until the charter itself changes the internal shortname of its own custom.
